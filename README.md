# Kurt MyReads Project

This is the project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course.

The goal is to create a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

- need to install react router with:
  `npm install --save react-router-dom`

## Search Page

## Main Page

- The main page show three categories (or “bookshelves”) for books (currently reading, want to read, and read).
